# VR builder

Build stuff, in VR.

Built using a-frame VR.

Built for / tested in Oculus Quest.


## Local development

Currently doing local development with IDEA and chrome, pushing to [github](https://github.com/damned/vr-builder) and
doing a `git pull` then `refresh` in terminal on glitch.com.

As project is served out of public folder ATM you need to serve out of public directory to get correct relative
references in pages locally.

There's a `docker-compose` config setup to run this out of docker on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/):

```
docker-compose up
```
